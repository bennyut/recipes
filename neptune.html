        <h3><em>“Even when we disappear and new Sailor Guardians are born, Sailor Moon, you will always be invincible. The most beautiful shining star.”</em></h3>
        <p id="michiruDesc">Usagi Tsukino just a 14-year-old crybaby from Azabu-Juban...until she met a cat with a crescent moon on her
             forehead named Luna. It was then that she learned that she had the power to protect the humans of Earth by transforming into the unstoppable Sailor Moon.
                With the newfound powers granted by the legendary Silver Crystal, she has taken down every enemy that has threatened the safety of her friends and established 
                an era of peace for the entire universe. If you're planning to take over the galaxy anytime soon, be on the lookout for the one named Sailor Moon!</p>
